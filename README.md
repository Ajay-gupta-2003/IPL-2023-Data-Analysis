# IPL-2023-Data-Analysis
Our project focuses on modeling IPL (Indian Premier League) data 
using Jupyter Notebook for Python code development. 
Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, 
we aim to extract insights, predict match outcomes, 
and uncover patterns within IPL data. By analyzing historical
match data, player statistics, and team performances, we strive
to provide valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, team management, and stakeholders 
involved in the IPL ecosystem. Our project integrates interactive data analysis, model prototyping, 
and visualization capabilities offered by Jupyter Notebook, making it a versatile platform for exploring and understanding IPL data.
